            </div>
            <p>
                Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in
                web pages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is
                processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>HTML has included semantic markup since its inception.[1] In an HTML document, the author may, among
                other things, "start with a title; add headings and paragraphs; add emphasis to [the] text; add images;
                add links to other pages; [and] use various kinds of lists". --Other historical data about html

                <h2>Google "rich snippets"</h2>
            </div>
            <p>In 2010, Google specified three forms of structured metadata that their systems will use to find
                structured semantic content within webpages. Such information, when related to reviews, people profiles,
                business listings, and events will be used by Google to enhance the "snippet", or short piece of quoted
                text that is shown when the page appears in search listings.
                Google specifies that that data may be given using <strong>microdata, microformats or RDFa.</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h4>Microdata</h4>
                <p>Microdata is a WHATWG HTML specification used to nest metadata within existing content on web pages.
                    Search engines, web crawlers, and browsers can extract and process Microdata from a web page and use
                    it to provide a richer browsing experience for users.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Microformats</h4>
                <p>Microformats (Î¼F) are a set of defined HTML classes created to serve as consistent and descriptive
                    metadata about an element, designating it as representing a certain type of data.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>RDFa</h4>
                <p>RDFa or Resource Description Framework in Attributes is a W3C Recommendation that adds a set of
                    attribute-level extensions to HTML, XHTML and various XML-based document types for embedding rich
                    metadata within Web documents.</p>
